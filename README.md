# CREngine

I'm making a simple game engine.

The main interesting things that I have created are the class system (CrManagedObject.h/cpp) and the ID system (CrID.h/cpp).

Most of the systems are WIP, and require more work to be done. The code might not be very portable at the moment either, since it requires several external libraries such as Vulkan.
